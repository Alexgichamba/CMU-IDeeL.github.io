# Transitioning between semesters

1. Copy the last semester's folder, e.g. copy F70 to S71
2. Change the index.html's URL for the new semester, e.g. url=./S71/index.html
3. On the mobile menus and desktop headers for the past and current websites, add a link to the new semester

Or do your own thing :)
